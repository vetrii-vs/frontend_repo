# Court Case Management System

The Court Case Management System is a simple web-based application designed to manage court case records digitally. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete court case details through a RESTful backend developed using Spring Boot.

The backend application uses an H2 in-memory database to store case information, making the system lightweight and easy to configure without requiring an external database. The project follows a layered architecture consisting of Entity, Repository, and Controller components.

To demonstrate DevOps practices, the project is maintained in a GitHub repository and uses GitHub Actions to automate the build process. Continuous Integration (CI) is achieved through automated workflows triggered on code changes.

The frontend of the application is deployed using Vercel, while the backend is deployed on a cloud platform, enabling a complete CI/CD pipeline for both frontend and backend services.

This project helps in understanding full-stack development, RESTful services, database integration, and DevOps automation in a simple and practical manner.
